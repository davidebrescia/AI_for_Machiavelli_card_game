# Machiavelli Artificial Intelligence

Do you know 'Machiavelli' card game?  
Well, tell this software the cards on the table and the cards in your hand, and, sooner or later, it will tell you the best possible turn you can perform, in terms of minimization of the number of cards you have.

## How
I don't know if 'AI' is a proper name, because the trick behind the algorithm is --> brute-force.  
- Pro: the answer it gives is for sure the best one, because it saw all the possible variants. 
- Con: if the table and the hand is too complex, since the computing time exponentially increases, the software can take like 1 years to give the answer, unless you can access to a Google Data Center.

## No Jolly
Furthermore, the software does not support Jolly cards (it would't be too difficult to implement it, but the computational effort would become more huge) 

## Code
The code is commented, but in italian (as the card game!) and a bit messily. Maybe, in the future, I will make it better.
